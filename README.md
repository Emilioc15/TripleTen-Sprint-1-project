# TripleTen Sprint 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 1** in the **TripleTen Data Science Program**.  
The goal of the sprint was to build foundational skills in data handling by exploring, cleaning, and analyzing a structured dataset. This work prepared the dataset for modeling and deeper analysis in later sprints.

## Objective
- Understand the dataset and its structure  
- Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns and trends  
- Generate actionable insights from summary statistics and visualizations  

## Key Tasks Completed
1. **Data Inspection & Cleaning**  
   - Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates  
   - Standardized column names and formats  
   - Addressed nulls and inconsistencies  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)  
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers  
   - Identified key patterns and anomalies  

3. **Documentation & Reporting**  
   - Recorded assumptions and cleaning decisions  
   - Prepared visualizations to support insights  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
