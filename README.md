# Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning  
**TripleTen Sprint 1 Project**

## Project Context
This project was completed as part of **Sprint 1** in the **TripleTen Data Science Program**.  
The focus of this sprint was developing foundational data analysis skills using Python and pandas.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to explore, clean, and analyze a structured dataset in order to:
- Understand the data structure and quality
- Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Prepare the data for downstream analysis and modeling

## Key Tasks
- Loaded and inspected raw data
- Identified missing values and inconsistencies
- Cleaned and transformed data types
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generated summary statistics and visual insights
- Documented findings and assumptions

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Highlights
- Detected and handled missing and incorrect values
- Standardized column formats and data types
- Identified key distributions and outliers
- Produced visualizations to support insights

## Outcome
The dataset was successfully cleaned and analyzed, resulting in a reliable foundation for future modeling and business analysis tasks in later sprints.
